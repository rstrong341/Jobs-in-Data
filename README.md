### Challenges
1. Combine all three datasets
2. Use .split to remove unwanted characters ('K', '()', '\n', '$', '-')
3. Remove outlier values
4. Convert datatypes
5. Parsing the job title column to extract the needed job titles for analysis
6. Remove NANs
7. Use keywords to consolidate all jobs that had to do with data science/data engineer/data analyst into one universal name

# Part 2 - Analysis

After cleanign our data we wanted to take the data and create representative stories that give students a clear understanding of their most pressing questions on the data job market.
