# Part 1 - Cleaning


For this project our group decided to analyze the tornado occurrences in the U. S since 1950, and build a machine learning model to predict tornado category (EF scale).

Overall, the number of tornado occurrences has been increasing and presumably will keep increasing, due to the changing weather patterns in the United States and elsewhere.

### Research Question

How have tornadoes changed over the past seven decades and measure their impact in United States?
